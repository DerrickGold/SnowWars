AI Strategies:

The AI will randomly select a target when it spawns and seeks them out.
Using a box collider on the AI, it will detect when the target is within
throwing range. At that point, it's head will turn to face towards the target,
where it will then use a raycast to detect if the target is in sight.

Only when the target is in sight, will it begin its attacking phase.

Once the AI has terminated its target, it will randomly select a new target.
Some improvements would be for it to select the closest target, etc.
